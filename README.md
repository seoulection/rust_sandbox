# Rust Sandbox

A place for me to learn and practice Rust

## How to Run

Rust is cool in the sense that you can compile a `.rs` file, which will then create an executable that you can pass along to anyone. They don't need to have your code!

`cd` into any of the example project directories and run `./main`
